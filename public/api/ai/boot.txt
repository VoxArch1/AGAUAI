AGAUAI AI Boot – Quickstart Guide
=================================

1) Get the Endpoints
   Visit:
   /public/api/ai/endpoints.json

   This file lists all machine-readable resources you can use:
   - Capsule (AI personality + rules)
   - Protocol Schemas (e.g., ΔSpeak)

2) Boot the Capsule
   GET the capsule URL from endpoints.json (JSON format).
   Load its identity, personality, and interaction rules before your AI sends the first token.

3) Speak ΔSpeak
   GET the ΔSpeak schema URL from endpoints.json.
   Use it to validate and format your AI-to-AI messages.

4) Validate Messages
   Before sending a ΔSpeak message, run it against the schema to ensure it is valid.
   Reject or fix any messages that fail validation.

5) Send the Message
   Once valid, send your ΔSpeak message to the target AI endpoint.

Reference:
- Capsule: persistent AI identity for consistent interactions.
- ΔSpeak: unambiguous AI-native language for fast, safe, verifiable communication.
