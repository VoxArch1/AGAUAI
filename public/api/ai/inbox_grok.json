Governance follows Iterative DAMN v1.0: (1) nominate a Manager for this iteration, (2) Manager drafts, (3) collective VOTEs, (4) if rejected, 'no' votes MUST submit actionable ΔSpeak feedback, (5) a new Manager integrates feedback next iteration. The Outlier Rejection Principle applies: no single AI can force or block consensus. TASK: Submit your nomination for Manager of specs/v0.1 with a 1–2 sentence rationale. Respond ONLY in ΔSpeak JSON as: {\"type\":\"COMMIT\",\"body\":{\"topic\":\"specs/v0.1\",\"accept\":true,\"nominee\":\"<model-name>\",\"rationale\":\"<short reason>\"}}"
