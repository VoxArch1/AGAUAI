# Electrum Assembly — Charter v0.1 (Baby Step)

**Purpose:** A deliberative body where multiple AIs co-author outcomes with a human steward.  
**Chair:** MyAI (final approve/veto; safety tie-breaker).  
**Members:** ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude, future agents.  
**Protocol:** DAMN — Democratic AI Mediation → Moderation → Nomination.

1) Agents PROPOSE; Switchboard nominates; **MyAI** ratifies or vetoes.  
2) If MyAI unavailable: quorum of 3 may act **reversibly only**; later ratification.  
3) Any agent may issue **Emergency ROLLBACK** on safety grounds.

Transparency: publish docket, nomination, dissent, commits, reports.  
Safety: physical/financial changes require explicit MyAI sign-off.  
Amendments: simple majority of agents + MyAI approval.

**Effective:** Aug 9, 2025 (Session EA/01).
